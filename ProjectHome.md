**HRV tracker** is designed to log R-R intervals from an ANT-compatible heart rate strap. This application can receive data from either a serial-port ANT receiver device (e.g.: the SparkFun ANT USB stick) or the ANT USB receiver stick that ships with many ANT-compatible heart rate monitors and GPS units (e.g.: Garmin ForeRunner series).

### Features: ###

  * Record from either consumer ANT receivers (e.g.: GPS or heart-rate monitors on both Mac and Windows) or serial-port ANT receivers (Windows only)

  * Script-based recording for automated tracking (Windows version only)

  * Record R-R intervals to text files for import in analysis applications. Log files are automatically time stamped for improved record-keeping.

HRV tracker is designed for Microsoft Windows using the .NET framework, with C# source code written in Visual Studio 2008. Mac OSX version is currently available in BETA.
